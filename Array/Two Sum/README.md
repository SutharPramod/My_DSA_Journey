# Two Sum

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in **any order**.

---

## 📥 Input

- `nums`: An array of integers.
- `target`: An integer.

---

## 📤 Output

- Return an array of two integers representing the indices of the two numbers whose sum is equal to `target`.

---

## 📌 Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Exactly one valid answer exists.

---

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]


### Example 2
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]


### Example 3
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

## 📝 Notes

- The same element cannot be used twice.
- The answer can be returned in any order.
